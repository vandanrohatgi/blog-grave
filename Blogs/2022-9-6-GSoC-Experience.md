I just got done with **Google Summer of Code 2022**. Here's short blog about it.

A big shout out to the amazing mentors at OWASP: `Felipe Ziptria` and `Christian Folini`!

### Initial Stage

Everyone recommends to start working with these gsoc orgs way before any dates are even announced. Well, I tried this way and failed 2 years in a row. I lost interest half-way because I didn't have any goal to work towards. While this approach makes sense, this time I got to work just when orgs were announced. I contacted them (via slack) about the project idea on their ideas page. I worked on a proposal to solve the problem statement.

While everyone recommended I select at least 3 orgs and 3 project ideas, I went all in on a single org and a single project idea. I worked on that proposal for a month straight. Yes, I worked on a single pdf for a month. Constantly sending the document to the mentors, getting feedback, making changes and repeating.

RANT STARTS

If you've read enough "How to" gsoc blogs like me, they all suggest that you start "preparing" to "crack" gsoc. I hate how everyone in these blogs have a way to make this fun and exciting event sound like a chore. 

RANT ENDS
```

The idea which I chose, had the most competition. Later I found that the only reason I was selected was due to the sheer amount of detail in which I explained my approach. Which would not have been possible If I distributed my attention to multiple orgs and projects.

### The hiccup

After all the initial stuff was out of the way, I was just waiting for the announcement from google about the selected projects. I was greeted with a rejection mail at 6:00 AM in the morning. But the thing was, I gave everything I had for this so I didn't have any regrets (like I didn't work hard enough). I accepted my fate and thought about the next steps. 

I got to know that there was a miscommunication in the org admins and mentors and my proposal was not ranked, which is a step that was needed to be done for proposals to be selected. I thank my stars that I had some really hard working mentors who got this issue resolved over night and just like that, I was back in the game!

### GSoC

During GSoC I had to plan and prioritize my tasks. I had college and internship stuff along with GSoC. I decided to work mostly on the weekends for GSoC and finish all other work during the week. Little by little I chipped away at all the work and by September (when I'm writing this) I was done with everything. I'm on a full month vacation ðŸ˜Ž

Coming back to GSoC, one thing I cannot recommend enough was deciding on a specific day of the week to meetup. I did this via a google meet. Chat is a good way too, but a google meet makes everything quick (screenshare, rapid idea exchange etc). Mentors are busy people, so try to keep the meetings as short as possible (30 minutes at max) to respect their time. 

During the meet, we reviewed the progress, got feedback and decided on the tasks for the next week. After the meet I created a short summary of the discussion and sent it to a channel dedicated to gsoc. This was really helpful for keeping me on the track when I'm working on the tasks and keeping others involved in the project.

After the process was in place, it was just ~3 months of researching, failing, trying new things, coding and unit testing. Another thing I would add is, don't be afraid of changing a few things here and there from your proposal. If you find a better way than what you wrote in the proposal, persue it! 

### The End

Towards the end, I was free from my work at the college and internship. So I had a clear runway to make a final push for maximum completion. I consider my project still incomplete because there are still a lot of improvements left. But according to my proposal, the project is complete.

Oh yeah! I didn't really go into what my project does. It basically tests if the Waf rules from CRS team are able to stop a CVE or not. It generates a report of the whole test and sends a summary to a dedicated slack channel. I won't go into the technical details.
