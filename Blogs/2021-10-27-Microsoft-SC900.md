## Zero Trust Model

The zero trust model works on the assumption that everything is insecure, no matter if its behind firewall, IDS, IPS etc.   “trust no one, verify everything.”

This includes measures such as MFA and least privilege model.

Principles of zero trust:
- verify explicitly: authenticate and authorize based on identity, location, service,device, anomalies etc.
- Least privilege access: Just-in-time and just-enough policies
- assume breach: Segment access by network, user, devices, and application, use encryption etc.

## Shared Responsibility Model

The shared responsibility model identifies which security tasks are handled by the cloud provider, and which security tasks are handled by you, the customer. The responsibility for security differs based on saas, paas, iaas, or on-premises (100% responsibility of organization).

## Defense in Depth

A defense in-depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advance of an attack. If one layer is breached then the subsequent layer will stop the attacker.

![](did.png)

- physical: access to the datacenter
- Identity and access: multi-factor authentication or condition-based access, to control access to infrastructure and change control.
- perimeter: Ddos protection
- network: network segmentation and access control to reduce interaction between resources.
- compute: secure access to VMs by closing ports.
- application: application vulnerabilities
- data: manage access and encryption of data

CIA:
- confidentiality: keeping data confidential
- Integrity: keep data intact or correct/ un tampered with
- accessibility: making data accessible when needed

## Common threats

- Data breaches
- Dictionary attacks
- Ransomware
- Disruptive attacks like Ddos

## Encryption

- symmetric
- asymmetric
- encryption at rest: stored data
- encryption in transit: web traffic
- hashing: used to store passwords

## Cloud adoption framework

consists of documentation, implementation guidance, best practices, and tools designed to help businesses to implement strategies necessary to succeed in the cloud.

## Identity Concepts

Common identity attacks: The attacks that result in identity theft.

- password based: password bruteforce
- phishing
- spear phishing: targeted phishing

Factors to consider about identity:
- administration: creation and management of identities such as users, devices, services.
- authentication: how much info is needed to correctly identify an identity.
- authorization: what and how much can the identity access
- auditing: tracking who does what, when, where, and how

## Modern authentication

An identity provider creates, maintains, and manages identity information while offering authentication, authorization, and auditing services.

old authentication:
- present username, password to server
- present the creds multiple times if multiple related servers, with new creds for each one

modern authentication:
- get a token from an idenity provider using creds and then present the toekn to server for authentication
- the server has trust relationship with the idenity provider

OAuth and SSO are forms of  modern authentication. Single sign on is authenticaating once and using multiple resources.

When you set up SSO between multiple identity providers, it's called federation.

## federation

![](feds.png)

The user does not need new set of creds for authenticating with a new identity provider. The trust between the 2 identity providers may not be bidirectional. For ex. logging in using twitter on an Azure AD.

## Services and Identity in Azure AD

Azure AD enable their employees, guests, and others to sign in and access the resources they need such as internal resource (apps) and external (O365,azure portal etc.)

![](ad.png)

Each Microsoft 365, Office 365, Azure, or Dynamics 365 Online subscription automatically uses an Azure AD tenant. USers can use this AD for purposes like SSPR.

Editions of Azure AD:
- Free:
- Office 365 apps
- Premium P1
- Premium P2

Each edition provide more services than the previous one.

Types of identities in Azure AD:
- User: employees and guests
- Service Principal: identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources.
- Managed identity: typically used to manage the credentials for authenticating a cloud application with an Azure service. Its a type of service principal. managed identity manages the creation and automatic renewal of a service principal on your behalf.  Its of 2 types: system assigned and user assigned.
- Device: Identities of rdevices such as mobiles, printers, servers etc. Devices can be integrated into Azure AD using registering (personal devices joined using MS account), joining (For devices only in the cloud, with work accounts) and hybrid joining(devices on cloud as well as on premises).

Types of external identities:
- B2B: allows you to share your apps and resources with external users.
- B2C: identity management solution for consumer and customer facing apps.

Hybrid Identity model: identities are created in Windows Active Directory or another identity provider, and then synchronized to Azure AD. With the hybrid model, users accessing both on-premises and cloud apps are hybrid users managed in the on-premises Active Directory. When you make an update in your on-premises AD DS, all updates to user accounts, groups, and contacts are synchronized to your Azure AD. The synchronization is managed with Azure AD Connect.
