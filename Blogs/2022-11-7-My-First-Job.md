You already read the title! Just going to document what my journey was up till here. I decided to share because I felt it was a bit unconventional.

## 2020 (Dun Dun Dunnn)

I was not enrolled into an IVY league college, (as you can notice I don't even know what is captial in "ivy" and what is not). I knew I'll have to work extra hard for landing a job. Almost everyone in my batch was doing something mainstream or safe like Software development. Their path was already set. Religiously do DSA and sit for campus placements. I didn't have the luxury of campus placements because according to my research no company was hiring for Cybersec in my campus. My thought process was to find something I enjoy and I'll worry about by-products (like a job) for later.


So before 2020, (2nd year of college) I was already trying my hand at new fields like web dev, AI/ML, deep learning, Android dev... there were 2 fields left for me to try. CyberSecurity and IOT. I decided to go with the first one. Since IOT required some captial which was non existant at that point. All I had was an internet connection and a laptop.

It was January 1st, I remember feeling a bit cold so I went to the terrace where there was a beautiful sun. I had "Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking" by Georgia Weidman in my hand. I read and read and kept on reading. 

At first I found the idea of exploiting and finding loop holes very fascinating. Mind you, I was not one of those super knowledgable kids who had command over computers since they were like 12. I had a normal childhood. So servers, terminals and all that was very interesting. 

Without finishing the book, I went on to get my hands dirty with Hackthebox. I spun up a machine and performed an NMAP scan. Thats it. Thats all I knew. I didn't know how to make sense of that NMAP report. So, I read blogs and walkthroughs and started getting better. Easy, Medium and finally hard (no impossible machines though). I would post my blogs on linkedin to connect with like minded folks.

I would do a machine, write everything on this blog and move on to next. I finally landed an internship (through linkedin) with this experience. Mostly research and VAPT, bug bounty. Until, it got a bit repetitive for me. I know people enjoy it, but looks like offensive sec was not for me.

## 2021 (Getting there)

So I knew I needed to explore more of CyberSecurity. I knew I had an interest in the field in general but didn't know what I wanted to do. I moved to blue teaming. Doing labs on BTLO and wrote some blogs on it. I landed another internship. This time it was SOC. I had to setup a log ingestion with ELK. Finally create sensible dashboards with those logs and submit a video of my setup.

My submission was accepted and I started with the internship. I learned a lot. I worked mostly on OSQuery and SOC monitoring. But rotating shifts and false positive fatigue took a toll on me. My body cycle was messed up. I knew this wasn't for me. I left the internship after 4 months.

Then I moved to explore cloud security. I was doing Azure labs that are available for free. They were good but I was not retaining anything. I would solve the lab and move on. I wasn't applying anything to real life. So Linkedin came to the rescue again and I landed an internship as cloud security analyst. It was an early stage startup so I always had my plate full with stuff to do. I was enjoying the work (at first). Scripting, terraform, AWS architecture, AWS security... 

Since it was an early stage startup, everyone was doing everything. The work turned stale and I was mostly doing product testing at this point. And not the fun kind. I was doing manual QA. I wanted to automate the whole testing (and I know I may be making excuses just to not work in that environment anymore) but due to time and budget contraints I wasn't able to bring myself to do it. I left after a few (mind numbing) months.

I did some Web3 security too, like exploiting smart contracts and creating some contracts of my own, but that was it. I didn't have a very long lasting interest in Web3.

## 2022 (we did it)

The silver lining of my last work experience was that I got to know my interest. I was having a lot of fun doing scripting, automations, cloud etc.

I used to do a lot of side projects and upload them to github. During this time, I also participated in GSoC under OWASP. [Read here](https://vandanrohatgi.github.io/2022/09/06/GSoC-Experience.html)

If it's not clear by now, I used linkedin very excessively. I used to connect with people and try to increase my visibility by sharing informative posts. While scrolling through my feed one day, I saw a job posting for "Red Teaming". I knew I didn't have the experience for this but, (I always found the art of phishing people very interesting) I still went ahead and reached out to the job poster. 

While he didn't have a spot for me in his team, he did however re-direct my resume to a team which would be more suitable for me (security tools and automation). So I had my interviews and they went really well. I had to wait for around 3 months for my degree, after which I was finally onboarded!

It took me around 2.5 years to land this job. Not because It was hard, but because I'm very picky in terms of what I want. I had full time offers from almost all the past internships and a few more companies (Cognizant, Palo alto networks...) but in the end I went with my gut feeling. And so far I'm not regretting anything!


Thank you if you read so far! I write this blog just to express my thoughts and opinions. I don't even know if anyone even reads this! Reach out to me on linkedin if you do.
