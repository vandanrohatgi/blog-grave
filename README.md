### Blogs

Here is the grave of Vandan's past blogs. Vandan promised to write a blog per week but alas he did not keep his end of the bargain and here we are. We never thought this day would come (who are we kidding... ofcourse we did). But this repository is now just a mark in the history of mankid. (In simple words, I'm archiving it). This blog had dreams when he was but a child. It wanted to have blogs about Vandan's journeys and hardship. His exploits and adventures. But he just **had** to go ahead and get a job. Hmph... frickin simpleton. (Drama much?)

For now I'm archiving this repo, If I ever feel the urge to write again, you'll find it here... amongst my precious pinned repositories. 

To read the past blogs just click on the [Blogs](Blogs/) folder.
