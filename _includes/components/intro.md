The Termi(0) is the name of my weekly blog where I intend to post blogs about my daily learnings sprinkled with bits and pieces of my opinions and information 
that may look interesting but is actually useless irl. 

# WHY?!
I made this blog with the sole purpose of helping others understand concepts and give back to the community **all the while** documenting my learnings as a by-product.

# WHAT?!
You can expect content on topics such as Technology, Web application attacks, Networking, CTFs, Reverse Engineering, Walkthroughs or whatever I am feeling like.
So you are basically at the mercy of my whims(*muahahaha*). Just kidding, Please do suggest me topics that you want to see.

# WHEN?!
While the content can be a bit irregular in terms of topics, what you **can** rely on is that I am going to do my best at releasing a blog per week (mainly on sundays).

This Blog is made with [jekyll].

For those who are extra curious, the theme used is [friday].
