I just got done with **Google Summer of Code 2022**. Here's short blog about it.

### Initial Stage

Starting off with a rant.
```
RANT STARTS

If you've read enough gsoc blogs like me, they all suggest that you start "preparing" to "crack" gsoc. I hate how everyone in these blogs have a way to make this fun and exciting event sound like a chore. 

RANT ENDS
```

While everyone recommends to start working with these gsoc orgs way before any dates are even announced. Well, I tried this way and failed 2 years in a row. While this approach makes sense, this time I got to work just when orgs were announced. I contacted them about the project idea on their ideas page. I worked on a proposal to solve their problem statement.
 
While everyone recommended I select at least 3 orgs and 3 project ideas, I went all in on a single org and a single project idea. I worked on that proposal for a month straight. Yes, I worked on a single pdf for a month. Constantly sending the document to the mentors, getting feedback, making changes and repeating.

The idea which I chose, had the most competition. Later I found that the only reason I was selected was due to the sheer amount of detail in which I explained my approach. Which would not have been possible If I distributed my attention to multiple orgs and projects.

### The hiccup

After all the initial stuff was out of the way, I was just waiting for the announcement from google about the selected projects. I was greeted with a rejection mail at 6:00 AM in the morning. But the thing was, I gave everything I had for this so I didn't have any regrets like I didn't work hard enough. I accepted my fate and thought about the next steps. 

I got to know that there was a miscommunication in the org admins and mentors and my proposal was not ranked, which is a step that needed to be done for proposals to be selected. I thank my stars that I had some really hard working mentors who got this issue resolved over night and just like that, I was back in the game!

### GSoC

One thing I cannot recommend enough was deciding on a specific day of the week to meetup. My mentor was a busy person and had a lot of responsibilities on their shoulders, So I tried to keep the meetings as short as possible (30 minutes at max) to respect their time. 

During the meet, we reviewed the progress, got feedback and decided on the tasks for the next week. After the meet I created a short summary of the discussion and sent it to a channel dedicated to gsoc. This was really helpful for keeping me on the track when I'm working on the tasks.

After the process was in place, it was just ~3 months of coding and unit testing. Another thing I would add is, don't be afraid of changing a few things here and there from your proposal. If you find a better way than what you wrote in the proposal, persue it! 

### The End

Towards the end, I was free from my work at the college and internship. So I had a clear runway to make a final push for maximum completion. I consider my project still incomplete because there are still a lot of improvements left. Going by my proposal my project is complete though.

Oh yeah! I didn't really go into what my project does. It basically tests if the Waf rules from CRS team are able to stop a CVE or not. It generates a report of the whole test and sends a summary to a dedicated slack channel. I won't go into the technical details.
