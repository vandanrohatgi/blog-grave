title: More about The Me

---

Hello there! I am an engineering undergraduate in the field of Information Technology from India. I am aiming to make a career in cyber security, penetration testing and red teaming to be more specific. I love solving puzzles and breaking stuff open. I am neither a very outspoken person nor a web developer and I am wayyy out of my comfort zone right now. Other than that everything else about me can be found on my [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/vandan-rohatgi-352376180). Heres me on the left side dropping swag like its nothing. (*even though my friends think otherwise...*)

Well hopefully sometime in future I will learn some web development and maybe make this place a little bit more customized. I was able to make this blog because of the beginner friendly framework known as [jekyll] and the theme used is [friday].
