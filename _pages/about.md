title: More about The Me

---

Hello there! I am an engineering undergraduate in the field of Information Technology from India. I am aiming to make a career in cyber security. I love solving puzzles and breaking stuff open. 

I want to become a Security Engineer as I am a generalist. I feel specialists reach the plateau very quick and that takes out the fun of learning. As a generalist I have fun exploring and discovering new things I can do. I participate in CTFs. Root hackthebox, tryhackme, vulnhub machines. Do Blue team stuff like SOC and making my own IDS. My goto programming language of choice is Python. I am an introvert and an extrovert according to what the situation calls for.


Reach me out on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/vandan-rohatgi-352376180)!

Hopefully sometime in future I will learn some web development and maybe make this place a little bit more customized. I was able to make this blog because of the beginner friendly framework known as [jekyll] and the theme used is [friday].
