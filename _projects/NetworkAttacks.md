title: Network Attacks

## About

So this was my first proper project (*destined for greatness*) but like most of the things that came into existence for the first time in this universe
it turned out to be a mumbo jumbo of random stuff stuck together using duct tape.

Don't beleive me? Take a [look at it](https://github.com/vandanrohatgi/Network-attacks).

The idea at the beginning was to make a single repository for all the tools I made. After a few tools such as a sub-domain
enumerator and a http prober, soon I found myself just adding modules for all the network attacks known to man in existence. This was the fault of a **second** project which was in the works at that time. Can you guess what was the project about? Yep, it was an Intrusion Detection system to detect **network attacks**. 

My thought process was that since I am already making a logic to detect attacks why not make some logic to deploy the attacks too... *efficient* right?

Well I think I will sort things out some time in future.

## Tech stack
- Python 3
- bash

So I used mostly python for the whole project and there is little http-prober written in bash, I wanted to write my own tool in bash because bash scripting is cool. The modules in python were very informative though. Take a look at the next section for that.

## What did I learn?

The project looks like a monumental mess but the things I learned were `Pretttyy`... good.
- Network Packet Structure
- Socket Programming ( used in the basic port scanner )
- Bash Scripting (used in http-probe)
- Scapy (used in majority of my attacks)
- Github ( well duh..)
- Writing good code (Tried to write good code **with comments** for the first time)
